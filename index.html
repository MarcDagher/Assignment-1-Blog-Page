    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Anima and animus</span> the contrasexual aspect of a person's psyche. In a woman's psyche, her inner personal masculine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image; comparably in a man's psyche, his inner personal feminine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image.</li>
      <li><span>Archetype</span> —a concept "borrowed" from anthropology to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes. Jung's descriptions of archetypes varied over time.</li>
      <li><span>Archetypal images </span> —universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, often found in religious art, mythology, and fairy tales across cultures.</li>
      <li><span>Collective unconscious </span>—aspects of unconsciousness experienced by all people in different cultures.</li>
      <li><span>Complex</span> —the repressed organisation of images and experiences that governs perception and behaviour.</li>
      <li><span>Extraversion and introversion</span> —personality traits of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to psychological type.</li>
      <li><span>Shadow</span> —(archetype) the repressed, therefore unknown, aspects of the personality including those often considered to be negative.</li>
    </ul>
